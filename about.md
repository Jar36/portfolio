Hello, my name is Joseph. I am a Colorado based Jr. UI Designer / Web Developer, Dad, husband, life long learner, and ready for new opportunities. I love coffee, peanut butter, welding, and seeing projects through to completion. I have decent communication skills, worked on many teams, can teach/train and overall can bring a diverse set of soft skills to you.

My editor of choice is Atom although I am always open to learning a new one. I have experience coding with HTML, CSS, JQuery, JavaScript, WordPress, Git, and GitHub. I also have experience with PhotoShop, Illustrator and Figma. I am currently looking to join a team where I can learn and grow my skills in tech.

If you need a new addition to your team, please feel free to reach out. Or if you are interested in having a WordPress site built, feel free to visit me <a href="http://jo-romero.com/">here.</a>
