Hello, my name is Joseph. I am a Colorado based Jr. Web Developer, Dad, husband, Jr. Web Developer, life long learner, and ready for new opportunities. I love coffee, peanut butter, welding, and seeing projects through to completion.

My editor of choice is Atom. I have experience coding with HTML, CSS, JQuery, JavaScript, WordPress, Git, GitHub, Ruby, and Rails. I am currently looking to join a team where I can learn and grow my skills in tech.

If you need a new addition to your team, please feel free to reach out. Or if you are interested in having a WordPress site built, feel free to visit me <a href="http://jo-romero.com/">here.</a>
