## Explanation
With several options available for cloud storage applications, people still seem to be using a mix of them to address their needs.

Bin sets out to create a simple, user friendly solution that can meet the needs of people and allow them to create, save, organize, share and collaborate their content on the web.

## Problem

This project was to create a solution for a client who wanted to develop a cloud storage app and find a way to enter the market competitively with other existing products like google drive, dropbox and evernote.

There was no pre-existing brand for the client so all work would need to created from the ground up.



## Solution

Ultimately, through user research and usability testing I was able to come up with a brand, and product design that provides a simple and intuitive interface which serves both the client and user needs.

## Conclusion

Overall as my first project I would consider it a success in terms of learning. I learned that relying on user input was probably the most valuable thing I could do. User data pointed me in a direction that I may not have otherwise gone. It gave me more insight into what the problems people face when using these applications.

I think that if this project were to be developed it would be a competitor for exiting applications and could be something people love.
