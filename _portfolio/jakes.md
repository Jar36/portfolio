[//]: # ## Explanation
This project was built for a client using WordPress. The clients needed a new website to help increase their presence on the web and hopefully give their customers another way to contact them.


[//]: # ## Problem
The main problems that I faced were what platforms to build the site on, figuring out who the clients customer base were, the overall design and feel of the site based on the client's expressed desires, and working remotely since the client was located in a different state.


[//]: # ## Solution
After several meetings over the phone, I decided to use WordPress. WordPress was optimal since the client wanted to be able to update content without needing to hire a developer. The cost was low for development, and the time to develop the site was short.


[//]: # ## Results
Overall, the clients were happy with the results. They got a new website, that is easy to update, responsive, and allows for them to have another way to reach their customer base.
