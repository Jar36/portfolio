[//]: # ## Explanation
This project was built for my wife, who wanted a way to reach her clients with new content and connect them to her existing business site and social media.


[//]: # ## Problem
The main problem was to choose the correct platform that would be easy for her to use when it came time to update content. I could have built this using Rails, but I wanted to giver her a site that could be built quickly, easily updated, and customized to her tastes without needing a lot of coding knowledge.


[//]: # ## Solution
To build her site I chose WordPress, and installed a premium theme that we could then customize and style to her liking.
