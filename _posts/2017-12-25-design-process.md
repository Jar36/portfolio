title: Why a Design Process?
---

What is design? What does that really mean? I used to think that design was specific and concerned with aesthetics only.

### What is design ###

If you have ever created a website or an app before then you have had some experience with having to design an experience and interface for your expected viewers. Whether or not you knew what you were doing, you were most likely thinking about how the users would interact with your page, what the flow of users actions should be, how the page actually looks, and most importantly does the design solve the problem for the users that the site or app is attempting to solve.

All the thought that you put into the planning of the design in your site or app may have felt somewhat disorganized or maybe you had a tough time just getting started. I know that's how I feel before I start a new project. Usually, I try to think of all things at once which isn't really a good way to go about it.

### Design process ###

So far, while in the Bloc Design Track, I have already learned that design requires a process. Now that doesn't mean that everyone's process will be identical but there should always be some process in place. You can do a google on the topic and you will most likely come up with several useful blog posts that outline phases of a design process. Some might differ slightly with 6, 7, or even 8 phases, but the core elements remain and typically carry over to all design flows.

For this post I will simply talk briefly about what I have learned to be the basic and most fundamental phases of the design flow.

#### Phase I Discovery ####

As the name implies the discovery phase is concerned with doing some research. It is very important to understand some fundamental things before even beginning to create any visual elements. The designer needs to first have a good understanding of what specific problems the design should solve for the client. What are the goals of the site or app? From what I understand this process is most commonly completed through interviews, fact finding missions, surveys, and asking lots of well crafted questions.

<strong>Common question topics:</strong>
* What will the purpose of this site be?
* What problems do you hope to solve with this website?
* What is the scope of the project?
* Who are the people I really want to reach with my site?
* What actions or flow do I want my users to take?
* What are the technical requirements that the project has?

This is not an all inclusive list, there are many pieces to the discovery phase. I am simply listing out some of the things that I have learned about and used to help with my own projects.

#### Phase II Planning ####

Once you have gathered the research it is time to put together a plan of action to create the solution to your identified set of problems. In this phase a one might study the research, identify associated problems, create user personas and study competitors products.

#### Phase III Sketching ####

In this phase a designer would typically begin with sketching out a design, layout, and user flow for the site. I'm sure people do this in many different ways but I find it really easy to just use a pencil and pad of paper.

#### Phase IV Wireframes ####

This is probably my favorite part of the whole process. In this phase one will generally collect or create assets and begin the visual design, layout and flow of the product. I use Figma to create my wireframes, but there are several tools out there with their own set of features. Whatever you use should be well suited for your needs.

#### Phase V Development ####

Also a favorite of mine, the development phase is when we get to actually take the wireframes and code it up. Now some designers don't always do the coding but that doesn't mean that you can't.

What would you code? Generally, the working design will be coded up using HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, and maybe even some JS libraries like JQuery or a frame work like React or Angular.

The idea here is to get a working version of the design, then to test the working design, collect more information, identify any problems and then refactor or modify the design.

#### Phase VI Deployment ####

Usually the culmination of all of your previous phases. This is when the site is deployed live to a server for all to see. At this point, I think it is super useful to continue to collect data about the site design.

One might be concerned with whether or not the working design is useful to users, are people finding what the need from the site, is it still solving the problems initially identified.

I think that by continuing to collect data and analyze the site is really important as this process will create opportunities to iterate and improve the site so that it accomplishes the goals in the best ways possible for the users.

### Conclusion ###

The design process as I understand it to be is iterative and ever evolving. However, if there is a good process in place the ability of a designer to deliver a quality product will improve.

I am not an expert in the field, but I have been learning that by implementing some sort of a design process is of paramount importance to the quality of the end product.

Thanks for reading.
