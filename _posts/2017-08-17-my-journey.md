Hi, my name is Joe,  nice to meet you. The following post is a brief look into how I got into coding. If you make it to the end Good job! and thanks for reading.

### My Background ###
I am making a huge transition later in life from a maintenance mechanic to a UI Designer / Front-End Web Developer. Why the change? Well, simply put I am bored of my job, it’s not a bad one, I’m just bored of it. I never really chose this particular line of work out of a passion, it was more of a decision that I made back when I was 18 years old, sitting in a Navy recruiter’s office trying to decide on a job.
Over 17 years, several jobs, a Bachelors degree and I’m just now finding what it is I enjoy doing. It’s designing, coding, making websites, learning new technologies and having to use my creative and logical mind together.

### Learning to code ###
When I first found code or was experienced to coding lessons, I was googling about JavaScript out of curiosity. I eventually landed on [Codecademy's](https://www.codecademy.com/){:target="_blank"} website. After setting up a free account, I began learning basic HTML and CSS. It didn't take long for me to really dig in and enjoy what I was learning. Eventually, I found [freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/){:target="_blank"}, then [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/){:target="_blank"}, [Skill Crush](https://skillcrush.com/){:target="_blank"}, and finally [Bloc](https://www.bloc.io){:target="_blank"}. Each of the mentioned programs offered slightly different styled curriculum with different price tags. I won't go into details regarding the specifics of each because this post isn't really about that. However, if you are interested I would recommend visiting the links and checking them out for yourself.

After all my previous experience with other online coding platforms, I joined Bloc.io with the hopes that after my program I will be ready to jump head first into web development as a new designer/dev. I haven’t given much thought to what my idealistic goals are as a web designer/developer. So far, I have been busy and focused on the short term, like learning the skills, and being able to use them. I know I want to design, create, and build websites, and for great companies with good intentions. As far as what industry, or specific problems that I'd like to help solve, well I haven't pin pointed that yet. Hopefully with some experience I will be able to narrow my area of expertise.
