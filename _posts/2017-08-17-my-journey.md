<p>Hi, my name is Joe and I am making a huge transition later in life from a maintenance mechanic to a Front-End Web Developer. Why the change? Well, simply put I am bored of my job, it’s a bad one, I’m just bored of it. I never really chose this career out of a passion, it was more of a decision that I made back when I was 18 years old, sitting in a Navy recruiter’s office trying to decide on a job.
17 years, several jobs, a Bachelors degree and I’m just now finding what it is I enjoy doing. It’s coding, making websites, solving problems with code, learning new technologies and having to use my brain.</p>

<p>I joined Bloc with the hopes that after my program I will be ready to jump head first into web development as a new dev. I haven’t given much thought to what my idealistic goals are as a web developer. So far, I have been busy and focused on the short term, like learning the skills, and being able to use them. I know I want to build websites, and for great businesses with good intentions.</p>
