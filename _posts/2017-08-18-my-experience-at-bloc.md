If there is one thing I have learned throughout my experiences, it's that learning to code is hard! If it was easy everyone would do it.

### Bloc ###
&nbsp;In July of 2017, I joined Bloc an online program that helps people learn the skills necessary to become developers or designers. My program of choice is web development. It has been a challenging experience so far. There is a lot of material to cover, and because the program is time sensitive, you must really push yourself to keep up. The content is pretty good, I’m happy with what they have decided to teach us and so far, and have learned a lot. In addition to the curriculum Bloc has some pretty nice features to it. For example, you get a mentor, assessments, projects, and to top it all off they help you get job ready.

### The Curriculum for Web Development ###
In bloc, the curriculum is split up into different modules that cover front-end and back-end technologies as well as version control. *I would like to mention that Bloc is always evolving and improving their courses. Which means that their current offerings and structure may differ slightly from what they were at the time of the post.*
#### The Front-End ####

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* JQuery
* AngularJS
* React
* Git

#### The Back-End ####

* Ruby
* Rails

The first couple weeks students spend learning the absolute fundamentals. I learned basic HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. Once you got the basics down, you’ll move onto JQuery and either AngularJS or React. At this point a person will be very comfortable using Git and pushing code to Github. Students the begin project development. The first few projects will be directed and instruction based. However, the last few projects you are left to be more independent and really forced to build and problem solve on your own. Keep in mind that you will have a mentor to help you get unstuck, but the idea is to really learn. I can't say this enough, one of my favorite parts of the program is that as a student you are required to use Git a type of version control with Github a service to store your code online.

The format is very similar for the back-end phase. Students learn Ruby first, then move onto Rails. After the basics experienced, students then begin the project phase.

### After the prescribed curriculum ###

Once all projects have been completed, students will begin a career preparation module followed by a project based specialization phase. This is where things get real. As a student you have the opportunity to decide the type of developer that you would like to enter the job market as. Do you want to work on the front-end? Well you can choose your final projects to be front-end heavy. The same is true if you are interested in the back-end. Maybe, you want to show you can do both. Well then mix and match. I think it's pretty cool that Bloc helps you get the projects you need to really wow perspective employers in addition to career prep.

As far as staff, I have had nothing but good experiences. My mentors have been awesome, and whenever I e-mailed student services or career services I was always met with a speedy reply. So far, all in all I have been very happy.
