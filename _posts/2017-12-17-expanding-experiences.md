<p>Since I started the Bloc Web Developer Track I have learned a few things. One of which has led me to make decision that will hopefully mold my passion into a career.</p>

<p>What might that passion be? Well, during my time as a WDT student I built several projects and was exposed to and used Front-end as well as Back-end technologies. However, during every project every lesson I couldn't help but wish that I could focus on the design, layout and how a user would experience my project on the web. This posed a little bit of a problem since the main goal of the WDT is teach people to code not design. I found myself researching on my own design fundamentals like color theory, layouts, typography and font pairings. I even spent some time reviewing Googles material design webpage. All of this design stuff seemed to take up a lot of time from my coding lessons. I came to the conclusion that learning design was becoming more interesting than spending time in the terminal.</p>

<p>So, I reached out to Bloc.io and expressed my concerns. They were extremely helpful and facilitated my change of program tracks. So now I am set to start the Design Track and hopefully learn and build all the things in design that I was attempting to learn on my own.</p>
<p>I still plan to code, but I plan to use my knowledge of code to bring my designs to life.</p>

<p>In the job market I hope to be able to show employers that I am a designer who can also code, and speak the language that developers speak possibly bridging the gap between designers and developers. I can only hope that potential employers will see the value in that.</p>
